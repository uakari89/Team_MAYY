      <p class="content"> Mercury <br>

This planet is the closet planet to the sun and the smallest planet in the solar system. Mercury has no moons or water! However like Earth it is a terrestrial planet (made of metals and rocks). Days are super long on Mercury it takes 59 Earth days for the planet to complete a full rotation, in fact one day on this planet is equal to 175.97 Earth days (so long!)
<br>
<br>

Fun fact: The Romans named Mercury after their messenger god who was their fastest god.

    <li><img src="./images/venus.png" alt="venus" width="450px" class="hover">
      <p class="content"> Venus <br>
The 2nd closet planet to the sun it is also the 6th largest planet in the solar system! A terrestrial planet it rotates backwards but very slowly, but as the hottest planet temperatures can reach 900 degrees (super hot!) Venus is the 2nd fastest planet to orbit the sun taking 225 days, one Earth year on Venus is only 225 days. Also Venus was named after the Roman goddess of Love.
<br>
<br>
Fun fact: You can see Venus from earth without a telescope!
</p></li>
    <li><img src="./images/earth.png" alt="earth" width="500px" class="hover">
      <p class="content"> Earth <br>
The 3rd closest planet to the sun, and the only known planet (that we know of!) to have life as it has lots of oxygen and water. It is very old, 4.5 billion years old. Earth takes 365 days (one year) to complete a full orbit around the sun. The Earth is unique as we have seasons, due to the 23.4-degree tilt on its axis. The 149.6M km distance from the sun means that it’s not too cold neither not too hot for living things to live on.
<br>
<br>
Fun fact: Earth is the 5th largest planet in our solar system
</p></li>
    <li><img src="./images/mars.png" alt="mars" width="300px" class="hover">
      <p class="content"> Mars <br>
Named after the Roman God of war it’s the 4th closet planet to the sun it is also the 2nd smallest planet in the solar system. Mars is also called the ‘Red Planet’ as it looks red and has huge dust storms. It has a very thin atmosphere made from carbon dioxide. Like Earth it’s a terrestrial planet it is very rocky and has the tallest mountain in the whole solar system.
<br>
<br>
Fun fact: Mars is the only other planet besides Earth that has polar ice caps.
</p></li>
    <li><img src="./images/jupiter.png" alt="jupiter" width="1100px" class="hover">
      <p class="content"> Jupiter <br>
The largest planet of the solar system it is the 5th closet planet to the sun and has 3 faint rings surrounding the planet.  A gas giant Jupiter’s surface is made from hydrogen and helium and has a magnetic field is 14 times stronger than on Earth. One years is equal to 11 Earth years and has 63 moons!
<br>
<br>
Fun fact: One storm on Jupiter, called the Great Red Spot, is three times the size of earth and has been going on for hundreds of years!
